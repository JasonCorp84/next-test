# Best Practices for Using GUIDs

## What is a GUID?
A GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems.

## Best Practices

1. **Use GUIDs for Unique Identification**:
   - Use GUIDs when you need a unique identifier across different systems or databases.
   - Avoid using GUIDs for small datasets where a simple integer would suffice.

2. **Avoid Sequential GUIDs**:
   - Sequential GUIDs can be predictable and may compromise security.
   - Use random GUIDs to ensure uniqueness and security.

3. **Indexing GUIDs**:
   - Be cautious when indexing GUIDs in databases as they can lead to fragmentation.
   - Consider using a composite key with a GUID and another field to improve performance.

4. **GUIDs in URLs**:
   - GUIDs can be used in URLs, but ensure they are URL-safe.
   - Encode GUIDs properly to avoid issues with URL parsing.

5. **GUIDs in Logs**:
   - Use GUIDs in logs to trace and correlate events across distributed systems.
   - Ensure GUIDs are logged in a consistent format.

## Conclusion
GUIDs are powerful tools for ensuring uniqueness across systems. By following these best practices, you can effectively use GUIDs in your applications.
